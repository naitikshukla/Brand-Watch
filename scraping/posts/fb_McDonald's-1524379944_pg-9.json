It seems the people who work there have no idea what customer service means and don\u2019t have any compassion for customers. First, the girl who took our order had a smug look on her face and seemed miserable. Since we have eaten at other McDonald\u2019s here in Singapore, this was a surprise but I decided to let this pass. After a few minutes, I noticed my son wasn\u2019t feeling well and looked like he was about to puke. I hurriedly went to the girl who took our orders earlier asking for a paper bag but she rejected my request. I asked the person who was by the counter, Rebecca, I was informed she was the manager, but was ignored again. I called the attention of a guy who the third person I had to ask, but seemed keen on ignoring so I decided to raise my voice and practically pleaded for them to give me a paper bag as my son was already about to puke. This was the only time the guy gave me a paper bag. We hurriedly went outside so my son could puke and I was so pissed because what I experience with these people was unbelievable. Despite the lack of sensitivity from these McDonalds\u2019 employees, a lady approached me and my son and gave us a plastic bag. I was so grateful to her and thanked her for her kindness. After my son was done puking, I went back inside and asked for the manager and told her just how insensitive they were earlier. Rather than apologizing, the manager said I should be the one to understand since they had many orders and lacked manpower. I told her no, she should be the one to understand since it was a very simple request and they only had to provide me a paper bag which would only take a few seconds and it was an emergency. When I asked her if she\u2019d rather have my son puke inside, she said yes it was ok. Really???! I can\u2019t believe this girl, how insensitive, rude and uncompassionate she was. I\u2019m really shocked that this person even became a manager because her attitude is far from being the qualities of a McDonald\u2019s manager. They seem miserable so why do they work at McDonalds when they are required to serve customers. I really hope this experience won\u2019t happen to anyone else. I was so disappointed because usually most people in Singapore are kind and hospitable but this experience on our last day here was horrible. I hope the owner would help teach their employees about good customer service. Also, I found another bad review in Google about the same Rebecca who works there.

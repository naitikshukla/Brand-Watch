I placed an order thru phone ordering and was inform that the delivery need 75 min which was much longer than usual. I agree and even told the operator to expedite the order. After waiting for more than 1hr and 30 min, my food still haven't not arrived nor did I get any calls informing me of any status. In the end I call up the order line and was inform that they will get the restaurant manager to call me instead. No one call and after another 15 min , the food arrived , no apologies nor explanation on the delay of the delivery by the rider. And when i start eating my food I notice my Fries was already cold and my burger was a little warm only.

Having to wait 3 hours for our food and yet missing out the item my son was looking forward to... Hungry and disappointed, he started crying...\nI called the hotline and they put me to the manager from East Point Mall. She told me she will arrange for the shaker fries to be delivered. I told her I do not want to wait for another 3 hours.

I was craving for your fries since last night but you dont deliver past 11pm so I had to wait today. I was not able to go to your store until after work today so I have to suffer the whole day not having to give in to my cravings.\n\nAnyway, we ordered a basic meal, Cheeseburger (without pickles) and upsized coke and fries. I am so excited to eat but to my surprise, the fries is just not what I expected. I think it's left too long in the holding area. Well, my friend asked me to change it but i said it's fine. It's just so-so for me but not that terrible. Oh but hey, another surprise! After my first cheeseburger bite, surprise!  No cheese. Who orders a cheeseburger with no cheese? Since I felt cheated, I told the store manager that my cheeseburger doesn't have any cheese. I have to open my burger in front of queuing customers. What happens next is what I could not take. \n\nThe manager, opened my burger, half-shouted at me and asked: \"What do you want? You want cheese is it?\" To which I answered: \"Of course I want cheese, I ordered a cheeseburger!\". She then got my burger which I thought she will throw away. And I was not at all surprised when she handed me the same burger and just added cheese. Wow, what is food sanitation, right?\n\nWell, just sharing my experience and hopefully other customers will not experience it.\n\nOh, and sharing a photo of my very delicious cheeseburger.", "created_time": "2016-07-12T11:09:18+0000", "id": "1114170885296150_1127584167288155"}, {"message": "FREE WIFI IM LOVING IT", "created_time": "2016-07-16T01:06:24+0000", "id": "1114170885296150_1130143790365526"}, {"message": "Really... i orderd 2 apple pies and gave me banana?\ni mean seriously,without informing me that the apple pies aren't available i cant accept this.

I was teasing a friend, that \"at the rate they are serving, i guess many of us were to starve the whole day.\" Thats when one of your indian lady staff overheard and said, \"if you cant wait, eat elsewhere\". I told her off nicely that i was talking to my friend and she should probably be concentrating on her work. In which she replied, \"cant you see that i'm working, u Stupid malay?\"\nI was shocked and when asked her to repeat, she said \"yup. I called u stupid\" with a louder tone which others can hear.\n\nEmbarrased, i told the assistant manager in charge. N when he  confronted her, she did not deny. And all your manager could do was provide this 2 complimentary cards to me instead? As i was rushing for time, i did not make such a big deal.

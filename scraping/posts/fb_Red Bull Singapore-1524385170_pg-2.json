Hospital food is non appetising and I grown fatter due to mum's terrific cooking .\n\nI started running a few months after being well. The main aim is to lose weight - around 8 kg. I run twice a week for 30-40 minutes, clocking 4km each time. I grew to love running and participated in Shape marathon and the Music Run this year!\n\nI have also roped in my dad and mum to join me in my run at the stadium! This is the best time to exercise and keep fit! Exercise appeals to everyone!!\n\n I LUV RUNNING! Running shares the pain and torture. Running develops love over time, brings joy to everyone and makes an angry man put down his fist. Running brings a smile to the lips on contact, leaving despair and negative feelings behind. Running is a true friend, a BFF, a intimate lover. Running warms and comforts and sympathizes. Simply put, it is heaven! I love running !\n\nI love running everyway,\nI' m running in the day,\nI love running everyway,\nI live for running under the sun ray,\n\nMy heart is like sunshine shining on the hay,\nI'm feeling cheerful and gay,\nRunning is great, as everyone say,\nI hope to run forever!\n\nIf Adele runs while singing, it'll goes like this\nNevermind, I find somewhere like Red Bull Singapore\nI wish everything and the best for running\nDon't forget me, I beg, I remember you, Red Bull Singapore\nSometimes, it (love) last in running but sometimes it stays instead!!\n\nMy favourite quote by Sir Winston Churchhill is \u201cSuccess is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.\u201d Never give up, put in all your effort and never stop trying!\nNg Siew Hong\n\nYak Seng Teh\n\nTeh Guo Pei", "created_time": "2017-10-26T03:26:22+0000", "id": "1660653217341785_1662991093774664"}, {"message": "I am a loyal customer of Red Bull Singapore !

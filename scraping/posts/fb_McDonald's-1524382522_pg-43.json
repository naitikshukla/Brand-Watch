I have been ordering the Happy Meal for my daugter through McDelivery online every other week & 99% of my orders doesn't come with a toy. Each time I thought the rider might have forgotten to pass it to me. The order before my latest order, when I didn't receive the toy, I called the hotline to inform & the staff told me she would get the store manager, which handled my order, to call me. I waited to disappontment but instead, I got 2 toys, which I find it like an act of bribery. Then my recent order, which I ordered online, I actually indicated on the remarks column to not forget the toy, then again when the rider came, I checked & it was missing. This time i was furious. I called the hotline & asked, to my suprise, the staff told me to indicate on the remarks column, which I did during that order, if I wanted the toy. Why do I need to do so when it's a Happy Meal & it SHOULD comes with a toy?? It's just too ridiculous. When I bought it over the counter, I don't need to request for it. It's not a Happy Meal if it doesn't comes with a toy.   \n\nI could pm u my email address which was used to place all the orders if you wish to clarify.

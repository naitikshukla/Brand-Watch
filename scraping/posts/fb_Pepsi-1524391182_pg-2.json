People sign here please (Rainforest Action Network). Workers on palm oil plantations\u2013\u2013including men, women, and children\u2013\u2013are being exploited every single day to make Conflict Palm Oil for cheap snack foods like those made by PepsiCo.\n\nPepsiCo has been turning a blind eye to the impacts of its palm oil supply chain for years. Now a new report by RAN, OPPUK and ILRF shows that PepsiCo\u2019s partner Indofood is cheating its workers out of fair pay and benefits, threatening workers\u2019 health with toxic chemicals, and compelling workers to hire children and bring their spouses to work through an unjust wage system.\n\nOver the course of the last two years, PepsiCo has failed over and over again to take meaningful action and address its Conflict Palm Oil problem. We cannot let the snack food giant get away with it! Every day that PepsiCo refuses to take action is another day where palm oil workers are exploited, children are working on plantations rather than in school, and ecosystems are destroyed.\n\nWe are ramping up pressure on the people who sign off each and every day on PepsiCo\u2019s flawed business model, and we need you to stand in solidarity with workers as we take our demands to the company's CEO, Ms. Indra Nooyi. Will you stand in solidarity with palm oil workers? Add your name and send a message to PepsiCo\u2019s CEO Ms. Indra Nooyi today.", "created_time": "2016-06-18T12:19:41+0000", "id": "1002603473110627_1032518610119113"}, {"message": "\u2764\u2764\u2764 Fee Downlad Music Video Playlist http://www.anickan.blogspot.co.at/2016/04/free-download-music.html  \n\n\ud83d\ude04\u2665 \ud83d\ude09\u2665\ud83d\ude06 Free Download New Music & a Great Day \n\nCheck out this \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude09\nNew Sound Synth Song,s Love,Wonder,Human Greed Classic Piano .... \n http://www.reverbnation.com/dj77\n\n#Like #Listen #Love #Now #Please  #Thanks #Rank 1  #Top1\n\n\u2764\ud83d\udc9a\u2764Check out this \"Dj's Songs\" playlist on ReverbNation Discover NEW Song's Love - New Genre , New Phone - New Synth, Univers - Ambient/Chill Out/Goa , Wonder-Ambient/Chillout,   \n\nPlaylist \nhttp://reverb.fm/ul/playlists?id=playlist_A1287296-4 \n\nPlaylist \n\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc9a     http://www.reverbnation.com/dj77/playlist/-4\n\n\u263a \ud83d\udc96\ud83d\ude03\u2764 Please #Follow #My #Thank,s http://www.twitter.com/axefantastic", "created_time": "2016-05-14T13:32:28+0000", "id": "1002603473110627_1012930162077958"}, {"message": "Rivoglio lo sponsor della juve caserta basket con pepsi dai rosario Caputo", "created_time": "2016-05-26T06:18:36+0000", "id": "1002603473110627_1019299464774361"}, {"message": "My kind of drink through out the year Pepsi\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude04", "created_time": "2016-12-12T21:41:51+0000", "id": "1002603473110627_1176487209055585"}, {"message": "can you answer me please , why Pepsi prices raised in Egypt ?", "created_time": "2016-06-02T08:23:26+0000", "id": "1002603473110627_1023532651017709"}, {"message": "join us\nhttps://www.facebook.com/red.circle.the.production.house/videos/1050880551613929/?pnref=story", "created_time": "2016-05-15T09:44:32+0000", "id": "1002603473110627_1013473162023658"}, {"message": "Pls Pepsi aw can I locate ur distributors here in afro media badagry express way", "created_time": "2016-05-16T23:43:47+0000", "id": "1002603473110627_1014362548601386"}, {"message": "1oo cars scam", "created_time": "2016-06-11T10:38:26+0000", "id": "1002603473110627_1028626657174975"}, {"message": "cosacerchiedove .........", "created_time": "2016-05-13T12:34:06+0000", "id": "1002603473110627_1012326795471628"}, {"message": "Cool gif", "created_time": "2016-05-11T17:47:22+0000", "id": "1002603473110627_1011433375560970"}, {"message": "Eine gute Idee  und einfach  niedlich und  cool.", "created_time": "2016-08-20T19:39:57+0000", "id": "1002603473110627_1072219099482397"}, {"message": "Gee Ann", "created_time": "2016-05-12T10:21:09+0000", "id": "1002603473110627_1011787565525551"}, {"message": "BOYCOTT PEPSI", "created_time": "2016-11-15T23:17:05+0000", "id": "1002603473110627_1145542395483400"}, {"message": "BOYCOTT PEPSI", "created_time": "2016-11-16T16:17:54+0000", "id": "1002603473110627_1146299405407699"}, {"message": "Line Thomsen", "created_time": "2016-11-19T17:05:59+0000", "id": "1002603473110627_1149105945127045"}, {"message": "https://goo.gl/v2bd85", "created_time": "2016-06-11T08:52:26+0000", "id": "1002603473110627_1028600007177640"}, {"message": "Dr igein is a real spell caster, he is so powerful, unique, and amazing.

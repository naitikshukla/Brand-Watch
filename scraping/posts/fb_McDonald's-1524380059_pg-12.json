I was kind of unhappy with it and checked on the time stated on receipt when our orders were placed. It was 12.47am!\nThe same lady went outside to talked with the other customers, (I assume it was also regarding the closure) and they seemed unhappy too. \n\nThe staffs then dimmed all the lights at 1am, hinting us that they're closing. We tried to finish the foods as soon as we can. \nThen, here comes their shift manager telling us that they're closing soon! My bf politely apologise and start stuffing all the french fries into his mouth, as he doesn't want to waste the food due to the chasing. \nWhen we were finally finishing the food, the staff switched off most of the lights at the seats area while still packing for delivery inside.\n\nAfter I washed my hands, I went towards the counter wanting to ask for some serviette, everyone was busy packing for delivery/closing. So I decided to take it myself, as the packet of serviette were placed on the counter table and I didn't want to trouble them.\nOne of the cashier lady then made a big fuss about it and said \"Excuse me?!\" I told her I was just getting some serviette with a smile. She then said \"Next time please ask!\" with a super rude and annoyed face. \nI was like, what the hell?! What's so precious about the serviette? Do you even need to be so worked up?\nDespite the poor customers service, I still somehow cleared up the table for the cleaner aunty.\n\nI would say we're a super regular customers there. But due to this incident, I'll not go in as often anymore. \n\nP/S: If you guys are closing at 1am, then don't accept anymore dine in after 12.30am.

When staff mopped, then I can smell the bad odour. \nStarting our meal, my husband asked to go home.  Going down staircase, at certain steps I can smell it.\nWhen we reached home, my husband complained of stomach pain. I gave him bread - our family's solution to stomach upset. 30 minutes later I rushed to toilet, followed by my husband.

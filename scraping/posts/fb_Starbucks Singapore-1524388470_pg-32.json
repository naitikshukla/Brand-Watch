On 17th April, I bought a drink which should be counted as double as I receive a SMS from Starbucks which says starting from 15th Apr to 30th Apr, one beverage bought would count as two. Hence, by right my purchase on 17th Apr should count as two, bringing my total of purchases to be 16 and thereby qualifying to redeem the tote bag. \nHowever, to my dismay when I visited your outlet at Vivo today (19th Apr), your staff checked for me and told me I had only 14. This is really ridiculous. Firstly, two points got missing for no reason and secondly Starbucks chose to end the promotion before the stated 26th Apr deadline. I had spent so much effort to accumulate the points to redeem the tote bag and now all these efforts are wasted.\nI would be expecting your management to investigate in detail how did I end up with only 14 drinks when I should have 16 and get back to me.\nI'm deeply disappointed with Starbucks and expecting a satisfactory answer or else believed my faith and support in Starbucks would be eroding.", "created_time": "2014-04-19T08:32:50+0000", "id": "10153956548710136_23541610"}, {"message": "I collect starbucks' items.

I would like to adhere about the prosperity burger which is the current promotion. I remember years back it comes with \"Beef/Chicken\", but now only the beef flavor is only promoting. We would really hope and appreciate that the \"chicken\" flavor could be revive into the menu because i personally don't take beef and i have chinese and indian friends who doesn't as well. I believe not only my friends but many of the chinese and indian commuters don't take beef because of religions view. I have to admit the fries itself is already making many of us drooling but please do consider about the \"chicken\" flavor wise issue even it's prosperity or samurai burger. \nOn top of that, i personally miss one big item on the menu and waiting for it to be back which is the \"Beef/Chicken FAN-tastic\". I could not remember the spelling correctly but it's kinda \"RICE\" burger which is launch in market during year 2005 or 2006 which i really could not recalled the correct year.\nAnyway i just speak my mind out in Facebook McDonald's Singapore page because i find it easier than to sent emails or feedbacks which might cause hassle.\n\np.s: I hope this feedback would not hurt any race pride or anyone feelings and if it does, i hope you accept my deepest regret and apologies in advance.\n\nThank you,\nBest Regards.", "created_time": "2013-01-02T07:41:56+0000", "id": "475030932543485_5082145"}, {"message": "We want to have pork Buger.nice i went to HK to try last dec....Hope that we can have that in singapore.Fantastic taste...super nice.

Last week, my BF bought Creme Brulee Mcflurry at Mac Compass Point and this staff served with with a real lousy attitude. First she didn't add the cereal and I politely asked her about it, she gave me the killer looks as though I have done something wrong. My bf asked if there was anything that we said wrongly, she didn't reply and just went on to serve the customer behind us. \n\n2 days ago I went there to get another ice cream and this time, you just happily took her own sweet time. \n\nThis staff is about 1.58m in height and wearing glasses. I didn't get her name. I hope the management would investigate the matter. McDonald has been in the fast food service line for many years and I have been a loyal and ardent supporter all these years. I would not want such unhappy incident to mar the happy times I always enjoy at Mac. \n\nLooking forward to hear from you.", "created_time": "2012-12-07T04:15:08+0000", "id": "464478183598760_1316799"}, {"message": "sld just talk to the duty mgr on the spot.", "created_time": "2012-12-07T04:31:52+0000", "id": "464478183598760_1316821"}, {"message": "me too had complaint b4 bt regretfully,they didnt do anythng abt it. their svc is no longer gd.", "created_time": "2012-12-07T04:39:17+0000", "id": "464478183598760_1316831"}, {"message": "waste my time going mac shenton during lunch cause they dont have it there!! big disappointment!!", "created_time": "2012-12-07T05:36:25+0000", "id": "464478183598760_1316912"}, {"message": "Plz make it happen at Bedok Mac..

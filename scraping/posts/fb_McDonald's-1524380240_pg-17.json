Estimated delivery time indicated on the app was 8.50pm.\nAt 9.14pm, my order had still not arrived. I phoned the McDonald's call centre to ask if they could kindly check on the delivery status. I was informed by Yvonne (call centre) that she would check with the Floor Manager of the Beauty World outlet. However, when I did not receive any reply by 9.25pm, I phoned the call centre once more, and this time, I spoke to a different male representative. The rep then asked the BW Floor Manager to phone me personally.\nThe McDonald's BW Floor Manager rang me at 9.31pm and introduced herself as Shanti. She promised to check with the specific rider assigned to our delivery, and to get back to me.\nAfter 10 minutes, I rang her at 9.41pm. Shanti said their \"system\" indicated that my order had already been \"delivered\". Imagine that!! - for waiting over 2 and a half hours after my original order had been placed, only to be told that we had supposedly received our phantom order.\nI told her that our family had had enough of waiting, and that we would come down to the Beauty World branch personally to collect our order. While we were getting changed to head over to BW, the intercom rang at about 9.45pm - with the rider announcing his arrival (at long last)!\nWhen he arrived at our doorstep, we asked him what had caused such an overwrought delay in delivery - however, we soon realised that he spoke very little english and appeared genuinely befuddled and apologetic that there had been a delay of this extent (for what was now close to 3 hours and 45 minutes after our initial order time). He apologised profusely, and informed us that he had only just received the order awhile back.\nWe then phoned Shanti at 9.47pm to cancel the order pickup as the rider had arrived.\nSuddenly overcome with a loss of appetite resulting from the long-overdue order, we checked the physical order receipt and saw that the time printed on it indicated 20:59 (8.59pm)!\nWe phoned Shanti once we saw this (at 9.51pm) as we had the right to know why our order was only prepared at 8.59pm when we had placed it almost 2 hours ago at 7.08pm (order preparation time was even after the indicated delivery time at 8.50pm)!\nShanti apologised but either could not/ or did not want to answer our questions, or even give us a reasonable explanation. We told her that we just wanted the honest truth, and would be willing to overlook it if the delay had been caused by some oversight on their end.\nInstead, she pushed the blame to the rider, saying that he was new and could not speak english. Our patience was completely worn out by this stage, and we were hardly in the mood for lazy and/or insincere excuses - and told her that customers did not deserve to be treated with such dishonesty, and should be compensated for having to pay for such shoddy treatment.\nShanti then asked how we wanted her to make up for the error, and then proceeded to made a mockery of the entire fracas by saying she would send us a duplicate set of our order right away (talk about adding insult to injury).\nI informed Shanti that her offer was offensive - we were not even in the mood to start on our delivered meal! I told her that we would much prefer our next order (up to an identical value) to be free, and that I would pay for any amount exceeding said value. There was much displeasure emanating from her end - however, the phone call ended on that (somewhat?) resolution.\nOur burgers and fries may have arrived warm (thanks to the efficient rider - seeing how he only received the order at 8.59pm) - however, the only taste left in our memory was one of unpleasantness.", "created_time": "2016-05-24T15:41:55+0000", "id": "1094422360604336_1097793403600565"}, {"message": "Nice and tasty!", "created_time": "2016-05-23T06:37:27+0000", "id": "1094422360604336_1096976827015556"}, {"message": "I can't eat any spicy food at all :( McDonald's please bring back Crispy Chicken burger I liked it alot and hope to have Double Crispy Chicken burger and also bring back wedges!

They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness. \u2014Lamentations 3:22-23\n\nWhen I was growing up, one of my favorite books was Anne of Green Gables by Lucy Maud Montgomery. In one amusing passage, young Anne, by mistake, adds a skin medication instead of vanilla to the cake she is making. Afterward, she exclaims hopefully to her stern-faced guardian, Marilla, \u201cIsn\u2019t it nice to think that tomorrow is a new day with no mistakes in it yet?\u201d\nI like that thought: tomorrow is a new day\u2014a new day when we can start afresh. We all make mistakes. But when it comes to sin, God\u2019s forgiveness is what enables us to start each morning with a clean slate. When we repent, He chooses to remember our sins no more (Jer. 31:34; Heb. 8:12).\n\nSome of us have made wrong choices in our lives, but our past words and deeds need not define our future in God\u2019s eyes. There is always a fresh start. When we ask for His forgiveness, we take a first step toward restoring our relationship with Him and with others. \u201cIf we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness\u201d \n(1 John 1:9).\n\nGod\u2019s compassion and faithfulness are new every morning (Lam. 3:23), so we can start afresh each day. \u2014\nCindy Hess Kasper\n\nLord JESUS...Thank You for this new day. \nForgive me for doing those things in the past that I shouldn't have done, and for not doing those things that I should have done. \nSet my feet on Your right path today-Amen\n\nEach new day gives us new reasons to praise the Lord JESUS-Amen\n\nINSIGHT: \nPsalm 86:5 declares, \u201cYou, Lord, are forgiving and good.\u201d The Hebrew word translated \u201cforgiving\u201d is sallah and literally means \u201cready to forgive.\u201d \nSallah appears just once in the Old Testament. \nBy choosing this particular word, the psalmist is telling his readers that the Lord is not only capable of forgiving our sins, He is also ready and willing to do so-Amen", "created_time": "2016-05-10T23:12:17+0000", "id": "1084857538227485_1089589921087580"}, {"message": "Mayor  saka ka naumiyak tulungan  mo muna si BONGBONG   MARCOS at mga supporters    PLS.", "created_time": "2016-05-09T23:22:01+0000", "id": "1084857538227485_1089000457813193"}, {"message": "My nescafe small bottle $2.80.... much cheaper can last a week on my night shift...taste good too", "created_time": "2016-05-09T21:56:18+0000", "id": "1084857538227485_1088963574483548"}, {"message": "I only go for McHot Cakes with plain tea without sugar and Nothing Mc's anymore.", "created_time": "2016-05-11T03:29:08+0000", "id": "1084857538227485_1089692537743985"}, {"message": "Are you still serving that delicious mcmuffin with bone?", "created_time": "2016-05-15T10:33:10+0000", "id": "1084857538227485_1092204950826077"}, {"message": "Absolutely the best fast food in this world \ud83c\udf0d hehehe \ud83d\ude00 lalalalala \ud83c\udfb6 enjoy everyone..!", "created_time": "2016-05-08T23:59:19+0000", "id": "1084857538227485_1088396757873563"}, {"message": "Good coffee...good company...:)", "created_time": "2016-05-09T23:28:04+0000", "id": "1084857538227485_1089002987812940"}, {"message": "I like mc donalds..specialy burger my favorates..", "created_time": "2016-05-10T00:37:17+0000", "id": "1084857538227485_1089031414476764"}, {"message": "I like double chocolate \u2764\u2764", "created_time": "2016-05-08T21:40:13+0000", "id": "1084857538227485_1088348427878396"}, {"message": "I like the $5 meal...:)", "created_time": "2016-05-09T23:29:33+0000", "id": "1084857538227485_1089003507812888"}, {"message": "", "created_time": "2016-05-12T22:15:07+0000", "id": "1084857538227485_1090725710974001"}, {"message": "Kopi o, loop, teh o, teh, only 4.

We managed to contact the customer earlier today, extended our apologies to her for her experience at our restaurant and clarified the situation.\n\nWe also offered to invite her back to the restaurant so that we may review what took place. She had declined and shared that she is not seeking any further action against members of our staff but awareness about guide dogs. We appreciate her gesture and hope to work closer with both her and the local Guide Dogs Association of the Blind to achieve this. \n\nOur policy is to be accepting of guide dogs and we will look into ways to strengthen our training efforts for our crew. We seek our customers\u2019 support to help us create a guide-dog friendly environment.

Your strategy on Hiring is a total disaster. Why i said this?\n\nExample: what will be the hour of your permanently day shift and night shift. What will the range of wages be for both shift Examples:\n$500 - $1000 dollar will be day shift & $1400 - $2000 dollar will be your night shift. All this information must be stated to your advertisement first. at the very least you give your applicant a rough ideal as in how much budget your company can stretch.    \n\nAs advertise on your poster \" speak to any of our Restaurant General Manager at our restaurant\".\n\nThis is the First Issues:\n\nI spoken to your Store manager in charge in Harbourfront a Filipino Female, she fixed a appointment with me at 4.00pm, I reached at 3.55pm. I understood that she is busy, but at least make a effort to inform her colleagues. \n\n\"That i am still in need to waited for her for a while more\" instead of me at 4.10pm going to the counter to informed her colleagues that i am still waiting for her to interviewed me. and your (Assistant Manager) although they informed her.\n\nBut They did not get back to me immediately instead they chat-chit a while and i need to asked one of your Assistant manager what is the \"situation\" his response was continuous to waited and finally at 4.17pm your Store Manager came to interviewed me.       \n\nI understood a applicant need to waited,\"BUT THIS IS NOT THE WAY TO TREATED A APPLICANT\".\n\nThis is the Second Issues:\n\nThe interview don't last for 10-15 min instead last only for 3min:\n\nYour Store Manager never had a formal document on Company Benefit and Company career advancement to shown me.\n\nYour Store manager: hmmm, you requested for morning at $1xxxx.\nbut we only have package of morning of $1400-$1500. Additional regular attendant bonus and punctual of $100. Night a bit more.\n\nYour Store Manager: so are you ok with O.J.T. me ok.\n\nMe: hmmm,ok.\n\nYour Store Manager: so you want the job?\n\nMe:NO and left the store.\n\nThe issues lie here ,Never asked the applicant for more question.\n\nExample: Are willing to works as McCaf\u00e9\u00ae Barista, Restaurant Management Trainee, Other then Service Crew? As your addition role or task and so we can Negotiate or adjusted your wages from there?\n\nMy Concern are: Don't see \"WHAT SHIFT THEY DO\"\nINSTEAD SEE HOW MUCH EFFORT AND TASK THEY DO TO PROMOTE McDonald's Brand.\n\nMy Second Concern: Some people are really not good at Recruiting people.\nYou should employed a Experience Human Resource to do the Job or have a HR to be at that place of that person whom is conducting interview? \n\nYour shift start from morning 5AM-6AM(for prep)6am-2pm all this require a lot of energy and Alertness and is equally same as night shift.\n\nIf you want a early start of the day \"PLEASE JOIN THE SINGAPORE HAWKER CENTRE.

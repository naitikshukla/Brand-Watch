He knew the family needed him, loved him and the whole family\u2019s responsibility was on his shoulders - so he worked doubly hard to support many of us including my grandparents and  my mum ( who constantly had heart problems)- even if it means getting little to no sleep after his daily multiple jobs. It pains me to see him working so hard - as it's not easy to be the sole breadwinner of our whole family - yet he never gives up and always tell us not to worry about money. No matter how tired he is, he always put our needs first before his. I had never seen him fallen sick, frown or complain dramatically over the intolerable level of hardship. He never once gave up nor chose to quit. He will ensure that we are well fed at the very bare minimum - which is what he always prioritize over everything. He is frugal on himself but never hesitates to spend on us, putting us siblings first before his wants and desires.\n\nHe is a good adviser if we (siblings) have any problems at school or at work. He shared and understood our problems. He is always the one we go for advice and guidance when facing obstacles. He always advises us to \"Go on and dare to take your chances, learn to fall and pick yourself up again and never be afraid of making mistakes. Live your life to the fullest without any reservations as a life filled with regrets is nothing but an empty book without any colours.\u201d. I thought it was impossible to remain positive and carry on when the going gets tough, but when I looked at my father, he is a daily reminder that the tough gets going and nothing is impossible as long as I believe in myself.  For that, he also advises us to always see the bright side of life not the dark side. I am inspired by my father for his advice \"failure is pillar of success\".  His foresight and wisdom protects me and help me all the time.\n\nTo other people, my father may be just an ordinary person but to me I am blessed to have such an extraordinary man as my father. I am really touched and appreciative the love and tough effort he has given us. What more can I thank for fathers like him.\n\nHis endless sacrifices and unconditional love on his kids at more than anyone else in the world.\n\nTan Alexandra \nTan Gina\nBee Tin Lee-Tan\nChen Mei'e\nBee Kiau Tan\nUmi Solikah\nBenn Kang Bennkang\nFish Yee\nBelle Ng\nValentine Yao\nCandy Lengleng\nTiffany Foo\nAnna Suharto\nCharlotte Kim\nGeok Bee Low\nKuo Vivian\nYu Xian Tan\nBeyounique Lee\nLee-Tan Zachery\nChris VirNeige Lee\nVicky Chen\nVivien Lau\nDo Minis\nLee Qiu Wei\nCedric Elijah Tay\nBoeyt Atanoso\nJoan Kong\nChan Wei Keong\nAdeline Chok", "created_time": "2017-08-23T15:53:05+0000", "id": "1550675558339552_1591674977572943"}, {"message": "Liked and shared this post with EVERYONE\u2606\u2605\u2606 Happy 35th Aniversary Red Bull Singapore!!!

Singapore does have a huge vegetarian population (Chinese, Indians, Ang-mohs and the ever rising migrant population. McDonald's does give all of the people in this segment a choice to eat out anytime(24 hours) & anywhere(with it's outlets spread all over Singapore). There's also a huge number of people converting to vegetarianism because of health issues.                    https://blogs.ntu.edu.sg/hp331-2014-23/?page_id=86\nHow to order a Vegetarian Burger at McDonald's  \n1. Choose bun - The Sesame bun \"may contain eggs\". As per the ingredients list of McDonald's. So, you can request to order their regular bun (which is eggless)\nThe Patty - Is meat free and fried in oil in which meat is not fried. But it does contain onion and garlic.\n(*Request McDonald's to drop onion and garlic from their patty so many more people with different religious beliefs can consume this burger)\nMayo - definitely contains eggs\n(*So those who don't consume animal products must request to minus Mayo from their burger)\nMc Chicken sauce - This is one of the sauces used in the Veggie Burger crunch. If you check the ingredients list in the McDonald's website, it says egg, onion & garlic. It doesn't contain chicken. But McDonald's does need to clarify why the name is Mc Chicken then???\nSo, while placing an order, You need to request them to avoid the Mc Chicken sauce too....\nThere....you have a vegan burger....but those who avoid onion and garlic can't consume it still. \nMcDonald's please look into this. It's not easy to have a vegetarian burger on your menu and having chicken sauce as one of the ingredients. \nPlease think of the strict Buddhists, Jains, Staunch Hindus. Many of them refrain eating onion and garlic during many festivities. \nThank you McDonald's for being the first chain with such reachability to think of the Vegetarians\ud83d\ude47", "created_time": "2016-10-05T00:00:00+0000", "id": "1191888734191031_1193591637354074"}, {"message": "Hi McDonald's , can you introduce the veggie burger from India McDonald's ?

I've placed my order with you around 8pm for an advance order to be sent to my residential address at 10.15pm. I waited until 10.40pm and my order was still not delivered. Then I called up the MacDonald hotline to enquire. The contact centre staff told me that the restaurant will get in touch with me shortly to update me on the status of my order. Another 15 mins went by and there was still no news. So I rang the hotline again to inform them that I would like to cancel my order and instead of showing me any empathy, the contact centre staff asked if I've made payment via credit card. If so, it takes up to 14 days for the refund. First, I did not cancel this order out of my own accord. The order was not fulfilled by MacDonald to me as a consumer and so, I sought to cancel. I do not see why I still have to wait for 14 days for my monies to be refunded to me. This is simply not the right way to do business, not at all. It is a service lapse on MacDonald's part and I presume I've the right to be compensated and proper service recovery to be carried out.

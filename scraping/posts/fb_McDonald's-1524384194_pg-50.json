However, there are many who would buy Happy Meals for the toys only to throw the food away. This post is about food wastage. When things like that happen, it is not just a marketing ploy anymore, it becomes a social problem. \n\nYour company is definitely not earning PR points when the few million other people (not queuing for toys) see massive food wastage. All that it portrays is a company willing to see food thrown away to make that extra few bucks off a craze. \n\nYour company can argue that (1) it is not a toy company (2) there's a food donation option that few seems aware of, but whether you guys like it or not, people are flocking to your doors because of the toys and not the Happy Meals, so for this promotional period, you are indeed functionally, a toy company. \n\nSo for your own PR's sake, please either highly publicize a food donation option and/or allow the purchase of toys without meals. Even without the meals, you guys will make profit off the low profit margin of the toys anyway. The Happy Meals just sits in the inventory, like any other day. Some other countries are already doing it, so this option not being on the table just smacks of excessive greed. There is nothing wrong with a company making money, just don't create a bunch of problems while you are at it. Please remember, your toys are creating social problems, and you guys better step up and fix it. \n\nI am very sick of seeing McDonald bringing out the ugly side in people.", "created_time": "2013-07-19T05:38:10+0000", "id": "567409856638925_5737421"}, {"message": "Joanna is meeting: Obesity", "created_time": "2013-07-19T10:50:50+0000", "id": "567409856638925_5737960"}, {"message": "Mr Heart Disease", "created_time": "2013-07-20T02:49:51+0000", "id": "567409856638925_5739990"}, {"message": "Lol la la la la la la la ...

We know many of you have questions about the programme, and we want to address some of the more common queries that we have seen on these pages:\n\nWhy didn\u2019t you bring in more Kitties?\nWe did. We used last year\u2019s Hello Kitty promotion as a guide and brought in 40% more Kitties this year. Why did they run out so quickly? The response from customers and Hello Kitty fans to the Fairy Tale designs has been truly amazing. We will learn from this year\u2019s promotion and it will help us to serve you better in future.\n\nWhy don\u2019t you put a limit on the number of Kitties each person can buy?\nWe know many of our customers buy on behalf of friends, relatives and co-workers, and we wanted to be fair to these groups of people as well. For the Singing Bone Hello Kitty, we set a limit of 4 Kitties per customer. This was mainly to prevent people from buying large quantities of Kitties for resale, and was based on feedback from our customers and our stores. We invite discussion on this and welcome your feedback on what you think would be a fair restriction.\n\nWhy did you suddenly introduce coupons?\nWe have seen public interest in the Kitties grow as the campaign progressed, particularly over the past week. Queues had begun forming at our stores earlier and earlier, and our main reason for issuing coupons is for them to act as queue tickets, so that our customers don\u2019t have to queue when there are no more kitties left. To make sure the coupons are distributed fairly, they are only given to customers who are already waiting in line, on a first-come-first-served basis. This allows us to gauge when stock will likely run out, and our crews can then tell customers further back in line that the Kitties are sold out.\n\nWhat are you doing to take action against resellers?\nWe do not support people buying the Kitties for resale, and we have been regularly removing posts offering such services from our page.  We take the conduct of our staff very seriously and if any of them are found to have misappropriated the Kitties for personal gain, we will not hesitate to take appropriate action."}, "15": {"num_likes": 1861, "share_count": 596, "type": "status", "status_type": "mobile_status_update", "from": {"name": "McDonald's", "id": "157162220997026"}, "post_time": "2013-06-27T02:11:45+0000", "comments": [{"message": "GG", "created_time": "2013-06-27T02:12:09+0000", "id": "557892457590665_5653313"}, {"message": "not every fairy tale have a happy ending....", "created_time": "2013-06-27T02:12:13+0000", "id": "557892457590665_5653316"}, {"message": "Yea we already KNEW it was sold out. -_-!", "created_time": "2013-06-27T02:12:24+0000", "id": "557892457590665_5653319"}, {"message": "welcome to REALITY", "created_time": "2013-06-27T02:12:30+0000", "id": "557892457590665_5653320"}, {"message": "hahha u're a joke McD SG", "created_time": "2013-06-27T02:12:34+0000", "id": "557892457590665_5653321"}, {"message": "Pls stop lah... no more better.", "created_time": "2013-06-27T02:12:40+0000", "id": "557892457590665_5653325"}, {"message": "crazy LOL", "created_time": "2013-06-27T02:12:43+0000", "id": "557892457590665_5653326"}, {"message": "Appreciate is one thing, will do it as action from feedback is another thing already.", "created_time": "2013-06-27T02:12:48+0000", "id": "557892457590665_5653328"}, {"message": "a super tough war!

Pls be clear whether your burger is vegan or vegetarian. If vegetarian, chinese veg or indian veg. Chinese veg usually can vary in egg consumption, cannot eat garlic onion. Indian veg usually can eat garlic onion. Your sauce is mc chicken sauce, we don't know if that sauce is vegan friendly or vegetarian friendly and to me the name suggest that there is chicken in that sauce. It is not clear. Over all the info is not clear. Pls carify my doubts so fellow friends know exactly if it suits them. Because for us, some vegetarians practice due to religion or compassion for animals. Any wrong intake can result in serious guilt and going against moral values. Doing business is one thing but being understanding towards a certain type of diet such as veg diet, has to be precise.

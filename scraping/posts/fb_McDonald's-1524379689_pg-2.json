Even when I have my Big Breakfast, I need at least 2 for each buns, 2 for the egg, 1 for sausage and 1 for hash brown.  And not to mention of my hotcakes (2 each) too!  \n\nAnd now I am only able to get 10 margarines the max?!  What the hell are you guys thinking to determine or changing my eating habit or preferences when I am the customer (regular)?!?!", "created_time": "2018-01-21T02:43:48+0000", "id": "1686032208110012_1689887651057801"}, {"message": "Friendly advice: You should set your device targeting to mobile only, 'cause this format doesn't work on desktop.", "created_time": "2018-01-24T00:47:43+0000", "id": "1686032208110012_1693012380745328"}, {"message": "MacDonald coffee so diluted not thick enough.Should change the  coffee brand.TQ", "created_time": "2018-01-19T14:28:25+0000", "id": "1686032208110012_1688304944549405"}, {"message": "Why Cappuccino at Mac served in papercup is $3.60 but at McCafe served in ceramic cup is $3?", "created_time": "2018-02-03T01:19:49+0000", "id": "1686032208110012_1703476886365544"}, {"message": "nzmu", "created_time": "2018-01-27T03:24:53+0000", "id": "1686032208110012_1696253837087849"}, {"message": "What a very bad experience we had in your Mcdonalds delivery... this manager name vashna.called herself manager who ant explained well why our food wasn\u2019t deliver. She try to find a reason but it doesn\u2019t not justify why our food was deliver and cancel it. They said they call my number but we never see any call or miscall at all. The only reason is why our food wasn\u2019t deliver was they deliver guy doesn\u2019t know how to press the buzzer. Claiming that the guy knocking our door. How can he knock on our door step if they didn\u2019t press our buzzer for us to open the get for them to reach in our door step. In her answer to me it only shows that the guy never really knock on our doorstep because he never reach on our door. Before u reach our door step we need to open the gate. In order for someone to come in they should press the buzzer. Now her alibi to me is they tried calling my number which I never receives call at all. I asked why do I need to call me. Her answer was because they are on the way to deliver. But the whole truth is the guy doesn\u2019t know how to press our gate buzzer. Then her next alibi was we need to call before we deliver. But why lastnight no one called us when they deliver our order or our order is going to be deliver. If u do call before deliver why lastnght and the other night when we order they didn\u2019t call me and the food still reach us. Why this deliver guy have to call me which they never did anyway.  They didn\u2019t managed to deliver our order. But why other delivery guy even without call us they manage to deliver the food. Then here is her next alibi. Tell did u out a remarks to press the buzzer. Oh my god.. I\u2019m a condo or a landed house in order for someone to let u in the gate or doorstep u need to press the buzzer. So I said lastnight and the other night we ddnt put press the buzzer but our food was delivered. She is finding an alibi which she herself can\u2019t justify their incompetent and not accurate sop when they deliver order. They said they call customer before they deliver order. But why I never received any call yesterday, the other day that they are delivering our order.and why we receive our order even without a call before deliver. And even we didn\u2019t put a remarks  to press the buzzer the food was still delivered. I need a proper response  on this.

But no notes are pasted on the machines to inform customers on this, so people continue to order. \n\nYou can imagine the customers of eat in & take away, all are waiting for foods. Yet the Mac staffs at the open kitchen isn't as 'anxious\" as the waiting customers. They look very 'lost' and actions are quite slow.

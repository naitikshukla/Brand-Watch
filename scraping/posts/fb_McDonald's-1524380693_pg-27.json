Which gives rise to me suspecting that the KK Hospital outlet seem to be the dumping ground for old stock at the expense of sick children. The reply i got is that \"toys from previous series will be offered to customers in the event that the current promotional toy has been fully redeemed\". I wrote back to mention that my issue was not address as the 'stock appeared' when i ask to see the manager and the reply i got was \"a standard specific number of toys for Happy meals are distributed to our stores islandwide. They are redeemed on a while stocks lasts basis.\" So again, how did the stock appear when i ask to see the manager??

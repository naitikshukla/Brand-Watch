And McDonald's was my favorite childhood restaurant. Do note, that I had no conflict and dissatisfaction with McDonald's until recently.\n\nI encountered a McDelivery Man who was not only rude, but also intimidating. He acted like a thug demanding for answers even before the purchase was complete. Yes, I was late by 15 mins as I was held up at work and my office is far from the guard house. A friend of mine who was at the scene was so frightened that this experience have discouraged her from ordering from McDonald's. I could understand if one is in a bad mood, but his actions were evident that he should not be working in a customer service environment. I was taken aback by such unruly behavior and made a complaint via email on 25th June 2012. \n\nThe response given from McDonald's Customer Care Unit that the relevant personnel will be in touch with me within 5 working days starting from 25th June. On 27th July (More than 1 month after the complain), I emailed ops@sg.mcd.com since I have yet to receive any kind of response. And till today, 5th September 2012, I have yet to receive any contact from your side. I am terribly disappointed with the service that was given.

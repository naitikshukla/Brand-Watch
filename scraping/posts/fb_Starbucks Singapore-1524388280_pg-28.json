Subsequently, I received a call from the personnel from ps outlet that the gold keychain did not come and they are left with the silver ones. I managed to find another outlet which has the gold ones and I asked whether can I collect the gold ones from them. This outlet advised me to contact ps outlet. I called the ps outlet n relayed the info to them that I have managed to find the gold ones at this outlet and whether can I collect the gold keychain from this outlet instead since I have yet to collect any from ps outlet n besides that ps outlet has no gold ones. Anyway, I have the receipt. The staff at ps outlet told me that they will contact this outlet on this matter. Till now, I have not received any update from ps outlet. Subsequently, the staff from this outlet called me to say that ps outlet has not contacted them n informed me that they will checked their side. Later, the staff at this outlet called me to say that they are unable to allow me to collect from them as the keychain is tagged to the card. This is a rather inflexible practice for starbucks to impose . I have not even collected the keychains and why can't I collect it from another outlet since the stocks are avaliable there. Besides that, if the staff at ps cannot guarantee the gold ones that I would not have bought 2 cards at once and instead source at other outlets. Lastly, no one at ps outlet offered me any solution. It is like just take the silver ones and get away. They did not even contact the outlet which has the gold keychain. In the end, the staff at the other outlet with the gold keychain even called me and updated me that they can't do anything at their side n provided me with a number to call. I am truly appalled by the system at starbucks for this episode. I felt so shortchanged and taken for a wild goose ride  and waiting game. I hope that starbucks singapore can give me an explanation on this matter. This issue has left a distaste in me and made me doubt the service quality and standard of Starbucks Singapore.", "created_time": "2014-11-27T13:13:11+0000", "id": "10154770354145136_10154791791475136"}, {"message": "Shannon Chermaine I'm so tempted :o", "created_time": "2014-11-25T03:11:16+0000", "id": "10154770354145136_10154783567175136"}, {"message": "Anyone knows which outlet still have the one in gold?", "created_time": "2014-11-26T12:59:53+0000", "id": "10154770354145136_10154788457785136"}, {"message": "Rory Creencia", "created_time": "2014-11-25T01:46:49+0000", "id": "10154770354145136_10154783337240136"}, {"message": "Amanda Kiki Panda", "created_time": "2014-11-25T01:08:03+0000", "id": "10154770354145136_10154783248850136"}, {"message": "Anyone know where can I still buy it?", "created_time": "2014-11-26T11:56:40+0000", "id": "10154770354145136_10154788356770136"}, {"message": "Gillian Sng Charmaine Lim Rebecca Teo Charlene Tan it's out!", "created_time": "2014-11-25T02:00:32+0000", "id": "10154770354145136_10154783368530136"}, {"message": "Sha Salim breakfast today? ;)", "created_time": "2014-11-25T01:02:29+0000", "id": "10154770354145136_10154783234565136"}, {"message": "Nice key chain!", "created_time": "2014-11-25T12:25:07+0000", "id": "10154770354145136_10154784466180136"}, {"message": "Levana Cynthia Evelyn Michelle Atmaja Youmi Ciel pengenn inii !", "created_time": "2014-11-25T12:28:28+0000", "id": "10154770354145136_10154784470585136"}, {"message": "Wil SeahOmg !!!

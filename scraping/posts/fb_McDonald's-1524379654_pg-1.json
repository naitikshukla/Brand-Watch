First the super long waiting time and its long ques. Once at counter the counter person was very hasty. I took out my coupon for the $1 off she direct me to mac cafe. then when ordering wah she didnt hear my order finish want to speedy speedy cast me to the side. already press my orders and miss out my fries order cause she was so busy figuring out why got this coupon how come i didnt know... Cause the store manger came and told her this coupon ya its order at this counter. Else I be treated like a Ping Pong BALL.\n\nI understand there were ALOT people but its common at Clementi from 4pm onwards it will always be FULL HOUSE till 10pm sometimes 12mn. And its so HARD to move about also. The counter staff all were sooo cranky and rude some so fierce. It really puts the mood very bad. As a consumer we will argh i dont want to come here but do I have a choice. \n\nThe other day I show my coupon at mac cafe they say sorry not available here only at mac counters. Aren't Mac cafes PART of macdonalds? the coupon so BIG label mac cafe some more... \n\nI know you maybe wondering I am someone everything dunno about macdonlds.. but I had work as a floor staff at macdonlds for few months during school holidays so I know the ins and outs. Maybe during my time standard of smiles were VERY important. Now... I dont even see a single smile at front counter anymore all I see are gloomy faces with (WHY ARE YOU HERE BUYING GO EAT SOMETHING ELSE) look. No matter which macdonlds I patronise to all i see is gloomy faces or VERY cranky looks. \n\nthe Management system still needs a better upgrade in places where there are peak hours and need more man power. Have the staff properly trained so that they do not jam the que lines for more then 20-30mins. (that is how long i waited at the line today) Cause the counter lady still had to go complete her first few customers orders by herself and I and everyone at the back were sighing... some left the que cause it was FAR to long. So better management would be great and hopefully there would be a better que system in clementi.

With the spread of vegetables (lettuce, carrot & cabbage)& sweet chilli sauce, it's perfect match. \ud83d\ude09 Unfortunately, McDonalds is not generous with the sweet chilli sauce. Perhaps this could be improved.\n\n2. Fish & Fries\nFish is not oily and served only with tartar sauce. Suggest to have the option to serve with the sweet chilli sauce & that would be great! \n\n3. Red Bean Pie\nTried the pie & nothing much attracts me. Heard chocolate pie tastes great but not selling though. It's good if McDonalds can have at least 3 different flavors of pies for customers' selection. Saw the variety selection of pies in BKK McDonalds & loved the sweet corn pie. Not sweet & so cripsy. \n\nPrice:\nSlightly high for a fast food burger set at $7.50 & fish & fries set at $7.90. \n\nOptional Serving Service:\nThis is a good idea especially to family with children, pregnant women and of course customers who love to be served. Giving customers the option to choose whether they wish to be served or not it's definitely a good idea. \n\nUnderstood this sweet chilli fish burger is only for a certain period of time.

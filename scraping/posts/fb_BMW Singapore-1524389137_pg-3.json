BMWs response? Nothing \u2013 radio silence. So above and beyond just ignoring our calls, they are also actively ignoring CASE. \n\nI have come down to a point of desperation and without knowing what else to do I am posting this here so hopefully anyone else that has been swindled out of their money by BMW or otherwise can help me re target this to raise awareness. \n\nIf there are any publications that wish to carry this as text, video or otherwise you have my permission and if you require any assistance with the formatting please write to me.\n\nI have already submitted this to all the news/publication outlets I can and it should start popping up everywhere fairly soon.\n\nAlso for those who care, the reason BMW in Singapore could not care less is because the people who own BMW in Singapore pretty much own most other prominent dealerships so they know there is nothing the common man can do to them.\n\n#toobigtoofall #bmw #cheatedbybmw #needhelp #customerservice", "created_time": "2018-03-02T07:50:30+0000", "id": "1851453538206989_1861557880529888"}, {"message": "Happy birthday to you and a wonderful day you with your love one.", "created_time": "2018-02-22T13:26:50+0000", "id": "1851453538206989_1852807321404944"}, {"message": "Happy Birthday", "created_time": "2018-02-22T04:26:04+0000", "id": "1851453538206989_1852366494782360"}, {"message": "Awesome CCA", "created_time": "2018-02-22T02:04:00+0000", "id": "1851453538206989_1852263881459288"}, {"message": "wow BMW  ...hanya yg mampu je..boleh ..miliki... hahaha", "created_time": "2018-02-22T21:28:33+0000", "id": "1851453538206989_1853205501365126"}, {"message": "Jess Chan Zeon Hkb", "created_time": "2018-03-02T01:58:35+0000", "id": "1851453538206989_1861334153885594"}, {"message": "Kristine Joy Sabino", "created_time": "2018-03-01T13:47:50+0000", "id": "1851453538206989_1860784323940577"}, {"message": "Joe How?", "created_time": "2018-03-04T23:32:14+0000", "id": "1851453538206989_1864826786869664"}, {"message": "Zach Li Caleb Chan James Lim Soon Shengwang", "created_time": "2018-02-22T10:41:14+0000", "id": "1851453538206989_1852600154758994"}, {"message": "Amila Silva", "created_time": "2018-03-02T01:50:16+0000", "id": "1851453538206989_1861327713886238"}, {"message": "Tilaka Chandra", "created_time": "2018-03-01T11:01:20+0000", "id": "1851453538206989_1860636830621993"}], "post_id": "160484413970585_1851453538206989", "post_text": "Whether it\u2019s on-road or off-road on a different planet, the all-new BMW X3 still fascinates with an exciting driving experience and impresses with its athletic appearance.

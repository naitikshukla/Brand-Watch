We know this is a condiment that many of you love, and sincerely regret any inconvenience this has caused you.\n \nOur goal has always been to put the quality of our food and the satisfaction of our customers first. In regular product checks, we have noticed that a small number of samples from our most recent batch of Curry Sauce have had their packaging compromised. As a precaution, we have made the decision to withdraw the entire batch from circulation. Our BBQ and Sweet \u2018N Sour sauce are unaffected and continue to be available. We are bringing in a new batch of Curry Sauce and will update once it is available in our stores.\n \nWe know many of you will be disappointed at this unfortunate situation, and we\u2019d like to try and make it up to you in some small way. From 10 \u2013 24 February 2012, any purchase of Chicken McNuggets at our restaurants will entitle you to a FREE treat with our compliments:\n-              4pc: 1 Soft Serve Cone\n-              6pc and 9 pc : 1 Apple Pie\n-              20 pc: 2 Apple Pies\n \nIf you are a McDelivery customer, please retain your receipt and redeem the offer at any of our restaurants within 7 days of purchase. Please check with our restaurants or our McDelivery hotline for more details.\n \nWe want you to know that we will NEVER compromise on the quality and safety of the food we serve.\n \nWe hope you will enjoy these free treats with our compliments. We are grateful and humbled by the support you have shown us over the years and we hope to serve you even better in future.\n \nYours sincerely,\n \nJudy Harman\nManaging Director\nMcDonald\u2019s Restaurants"}}

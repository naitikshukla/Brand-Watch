After we eat our meal I ask my daughter to take tissue to the counter, and I'm sitting opposite to the counter so it's means I can see her (daughter), the cashier taking order to the customer while my kid at side asking for a tissue and the cashier reply \" yes I will going to give you a tissue but use your manners!\" And when I look at my kid she look like scared , when she back to our table my daughter shows  me a scared face while saying \"Mama the lady told me to use my manners\" \nI can hear she talk to my kid but not really clear. After that I Q to her when I'm infront of her I told that next time don't say that again to my kid or even to other kids, she reply because she cannot wait I'm taking order  and I told her working this kind of line you must have a little bit patience as most of the customer are kids! to think that my Daughter only 6yrs old and she's not rude while she's asking for a tissue! When the manager come to her( cashier), the manager just laugh with the cashier like insulting me! I'm super upset and disappointed! Some of the aunties cashier there are very friendly they know us already as we mostly eat there Everyday. Unlike this lady she's unreasonable person!

I drove 323i and then 523i for 10 years and always serviced it at Performance - according to their service schedule. The last car stalled in the middle of a traffic junction due to the engine been stuck with hardened motor oil. That car was only 4-5 years' old. When I got it towed back for checks, I was told that they found hardened oil patches inside the engine compartment and even told me that this was the result of not changing my lube oil. What??? When I asked for my record to show how I had compiled with their service routines and paid for everything that they asked me to, the records were not even input (updated).  The cost of the repair was  over 10K with no assurance that he problem will be totally eradicated.  This case was documented with a copy to Performance Alexandra and a copy to BMW Germany.  I sold the car and bought a Lexus GS300 when the COE was 60K+; never ever to buy another BMW and sharing this unfortunate episode to anyone who wishes to know. I have driven my Lexus for over 4 years now and NEVER an hour of problem or down-time. Mine may well be just bad luck. My 1st BMW suffered gear problems when it was only 5 years' old and I traded it for the 523i.

I would like to lodge a complaint against your sales Managers  Paul Wee from BMW East Coast. I first sent my car there to check on a stalled engine as I was driving. To my disappointment, upon inspection, they accused me of not being prompt in my servicing of the car. This is absolute nonsense as I have never missed any service apart from a slight delay for 2 of them as far as I can recall. When I was informed that the problem is due to sludge that was formed in the engine oil compartment, I can't help but ponder. Is this a China-made car?! Come on, this is BMW! I know the quality of the car and it comes with a hefty price too! When the technician quoted me the cost of repair to rectify the engine was $11000, I tried to call Paul but what was appalling was that he did not reply or even made the slightest effort to consult me on this! I then wanted to look for an independent BMW workshop to ask for a 2nd opinion. However, the reassembly of the parts without rectifying the problem cost me more than $2000 ...(just assemble back)  After getting a quote of $7000 from the another workshop for the repair, I tried to suggest to the technical personnel about the quotation but apparently he found another problem with my car which, if repaired, would cost even more! I am not complaining about the price of repair. What I am more concerned is the attitude and overall service provided, especially Paul Wee or Tony for not console me on the matter.....! I hope the Principal management of PML Spore and Germany would have been more sensitive with the car owner after sales service and not just selling the car....\nFrustrated Owner...", "created_time": "2015-09-19T06:29:11+0000", "id": "1038134822872202_1043742128978138"}, {"message": "They need to improve their workshop, service and attitude.", "created_time": "2015-09-10T03:46:16+0000", "id": "1038134822872202_1039058092779875"}, {"message": "Hahaha.

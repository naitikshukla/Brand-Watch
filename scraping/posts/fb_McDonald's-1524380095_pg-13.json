I ate it a few times and realized that the cup which the corn is served is made of plastic, and it poses a health concern esp when hot corn is poured inside the PLASTIC cup. In fact, there was once I felt that the cup turned soft when the contents inside was piping hot, implying that it may actually be melting (?) or contracting, and it is a pretty scary thing if we consider the possibility that toxic chemicals from the plastic might seep into the corn due to the heat, and this is seriously a health concern that must be brought up to your attention. Do consider using other materials to contain hot food items, such as styrofoam (you all use styrofoam cups to contain hot tea and coffee, isn't it? Why can't the same be done for cup corn). Either that or you don't serve the corn hot - serve it cold instead. In short, plastic with hot food is a no-go. Worse come to worse, I would rather McDonalds remove this food item from its menu entirely.\n\nDo keep me updated on the outcome, or I may consider escalating it to the relevant food health authorities/AVA. It is a serious health violation.God knows how many people have been put at risk with such toxic procedures.", "created_time": "2016-10-27T09:04:12+0000", "id": "1191886837524554_1214414281938476"}, {"message": "paid for cereal and yes u can count those cereal with both hands. the patty is overcooked. macdonald we all know your hit-n-go marketing strategy but do it so that customer won't feel ripped off at least.", "created_time": "2016-10-08T07:01:15+0000", "id": "1191886837524554_1196307530415818"}, {"message": "order for ebi burger for my friends and family. ended up now almost all of them kana food poisoning. please do a check at your anchorvale rd outlet.", "created_time": "2016-10-11T03:25:36+0000", "id": "1191886837524554_1198803016832936"}, {"message": "Hi Mcd...

I've placed my order with you around 8pm for an advance order to be sent to my residential address at 10.15pm. I waited until 10.40pm and my order was still not delivered. Then I called up the MacDonald hotline to enquire. The contact centre staff told me that the restaurant will get in touch with me shortly to update me on the status of my order. Another 15 mins went by and there was still no news. So I rang the hotline again to inform them that I would like to cancel my order and instead of showing me any empathy, the contact centre staff asked if I've made payment via credit card. If so, it takes up to 14 days for the refund. First, I did not cancel this order out of my own accord. The order was not fulfilled by MacDonald to me as a consumer and so, I sought to cancel. I do not see why I still have to wait for 14 days for my monies to be refunded to me. This is simply not the right way to do business, not at all. It is a service lapse on MacDonald's part and I presume I've the right to be compensated and proper service recovery to be carried out. FYI: I ended up with no dinner tonight after a late night at work. All thanks to you, MacDonalds.\n\nRegards,\nCharlene Chen\n\nIt has been more than a week. Nobody bothered to  contact me.

Many of us Singaporeans are complaining a whole damn lot regarding the 30cents curry sauce, yet there is no response from Mcdonald's side. \n\nThere are a handful of us who opt for curry sauce only becoz we hate the taste of the garlic chilli sauce. I would like to see if Mcdonalds dare charge for chilli sauce and risk losing an even bigger pool of \"then-loyal\" customers. I for one, am truly a disappointed customer.", "created_time": "2012-07-27T22:03:29+0000", "id": "411379725575273_1090463"}, {"message": "They lost te basic courtesy of even dropping a SOP reply, ie thanks for your feedback!", "created_time": "2012-07-28T11:03:27+0000", "id": "411379725575273_1091327"}, {"message": "They even didn't bother, the staff even commented and call customers whom take more chillis. - idoits!", "created_time": "2012-07-28T11:05:03+0000", "id": "411379725575273_1091329"}], "post_id": "157162220997026_411379725575273", "post_text": "3 lucky winners have won some exclusive Coca-Cola memorabilia! \r\n\r\nTo enter this week\u2019s competition, just snap a photo of the brand new Purple Coca-Cola glasses showcasing the brand new design and send it to mcdolympicscokeglass@gmail.com!"}, "24": {"num_likes": 425, "photo_link": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/217850_410949148951664_482439468_n.jpg?_nc_cat=0&oh=ecb00bd213b09bf5ade52935fc5ba58c&oe=5B69A68C", "share_count": 44, "status_type": "added_photos", "local_dir": "images/217850_410949148951664_482439468_n.jpg", "from": {"name": "McDonald's", "id": "157162220997026"}, "type": "photo", "post_time": "2012-07-25T11:00:03+0000", "comments": [{"message": "Don't have to pay 30 cents for this?", "created_time": "2012-07-25T11:00:59+0000", "id": "410949148951664_1085994"}, {"message": "Nope, not curry sauce", "created_time": "2012-07-25T11:01:53+0000", "id": "410949148951664_1085995"}, {"message": "you pay about 50 cents extra~ i've got 4 of the aqua colour because i kept forgetting what colour i've gotten everytime i go to mcdonalds~~", "created_time": "2012-07-25T11:02:22+0000", "id": "410949148951664_1085998"}, {"message": "its not free. you have to pay 50 cents for that.", "created_time": "2012-07-25T11:13:25+0000", "id": "410949148951664_1086010"}, {"message": "Not forgetting additional upsize of ur fries & drinks for that 50cents.", "created_time": "2012-07-25T11:17:51+0000", "id": "410949148951664_1086014"}, {"message": "Yeahhhh.....already got the first 3colours, awaiting for next one which starts tomorrow.

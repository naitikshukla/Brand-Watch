In all these years, I've had my fair share of ups and downs with Macdonald's. I thought I had already experienced the worse from Madconald's the previous time when you sent me wrong items for my order, but today was an eye-opener. Your mistakes, your horrible servitude, you stupidity knows no limits.\n\nLet me share with you a humiliating and offensive moment of my life today, 17 April 2014, from 1.10pm-1.40pm. I was having lunch with my friend at Macdonald's The Metropolis Branch. I know that you guys have some Big bosses making a trip to your branch from the incident that I am about to describe. \n\nAt about 1.30pm, one of your staff, a female indian, approached me (wearing stipe top and an apron saying McCafe, I suppose she's in charge of the McCafe counter in your branch) and told me, (and here are exactly or along-the-line of what she said): \"Hi Sir, are you done with your meal, because our big bosses are here, can I clear your trays for you?\" \uff08Hinting me to go away, not just simply clearing trays to make the place neater)\n\nFor a moment I was thinking, there are some customers waiting to eat, and it's lunch time, so, I guess she's just being helpful. But WAIT! She said big bosses of hers. Those big bosses are a group of Caucasians and one of them is wearing blazer (might even be the CEO of the company) and at that point of time, I felt deeply humiliated and offended on the following basis:\n\n1) ME as a CUSTOMER should have the priority for the seat, because it is my friend and I who are paying for yours and your bosses' salaries! By telling me to give up seats to your Big Bosses just so for you to \"Wayang\" is totally humiliating, it's a though you are telling me that \"hey, I don't give a damn if you are a customer, because my big bosses are here and I need to show off to them how important they are to me, so it is just right that you just SCRAM\". This is so humiliating \n\n2) If you are expecting some BIG SHOTS to arrive, please have the IQ to put a \"reserved\" sign on tables just to block out seats for them, I can't believe how stupid you guys are.\n\n3) If I were you, I would have just said: \"Sir, we have quite a lot of customers waiting for seats as it is lunch time, do you want me to clear the trays for you? Thank you very much.\"\n\n4) We CUSTOMERS are paying so much for a meal, and you can't even send your employee for a proper customer relations course?\n\n5) I DONT GIVE A DAMN AT ALL THAT YOUR BIG BOSSES ARE HERE, DON'T RELATE YOUR PROBLEMS TO ME WHEN YOU DON'T MANAGE YOUR SCHEDULE PROPERLY.\n\nTo conclude, today's lunch was the unhappiest meal of my life and I will make sure this incident gets enough media coverage, starting with Facebook until I get a pleasing response from Macdonald's", "created_time": "2014-04-17T15:32:01+0000", "id": "692686057444637_2229146"}, {"message": "Will not order the green curry again .. prefer the sizzling citrus anytime over the green curry ..", "created_time": "2014-04-17T12:22:24+0000", "id": "692686057444637_2228933"}, {"message": "the green curry paste is not even spicy..and it taste quite bad :(", "created_time": "2014-04-17T11:43:42+0000", "id": "692686057444637_2228897"}, {"message": "Green sauce..not green curry!!!

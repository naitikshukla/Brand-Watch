Your Hello Kitty delivery is the worst. Not only did it take days for the items to reach me (my friends received theirs way earlier on 28 July). Your courier came at 9.15pm on 1 Aug but I was in the toilet. Through text messages, the delivery person told me that it will need to be redelivered, but if I want, I could pick it up at the next block across the road myself as he was delivering there. I asked whether he could make an exception and come back to my blk since it's so near and he said no. This is not right.. how can you make a customer pick up the item himself/herself as it should be part of the service. Moreover, it's literally just the next block, why couldn't an exception be made?

Went to Mcd Admiralty just now and ordered filet meal. After finished my favourite fries, found out that my filet was wrongly delivered, ordered extra sauce but came out no sauce.

However, after i went back to my table and found out that it was the same cold burger that i gave her. Thought mcd have a policy of replacing a new item regardless of how much time the item was delivered?\nNext, I called up the mcd hotline to feedback about this issue and clarified with the call centre staff on mcd policies which was told that that is true, they should change a new fresh item regardless of time once the item is out. But after the feedback, the call centre management did was asked the stall manager to call me back and checked with me on this issue, which the same manager who assisted me and she said, she have replaced the filet burger for me when i approached her just now but she did not know that it was the same cold burger that i handed over to her.\n\nAdditional, the other past experiences that i had in the same stall, i approached the staff at the counter to informed them i ordered a up-size meal but the fries that they gave me was a Large fries packet but medium or small size fries quantity. For this, they replaced me a new fries but the quantity is still the same \"medium or small amount\", which is not the value that i paid for.

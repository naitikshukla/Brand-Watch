And goodness knows how many other recipes have fallen into that category. Why can't we just enjoy the variety that McDonalds provides? It's not like they took away the Big Mac to make way for something else. And as for the McAloo Tikki, why is it just for the Indian expats? Local Indians can't appreciate it too?

The vein is white in colour because of the Halal slaughtering process where blood had to be drained. Food safety is our top priority and we take all feedback relating to the quality of our food very seriously. Our chicken sausage patty is actually made from minced dark and white chicken meat, and the patties are imported from Malaysia. We have also traced back the product\u2019s production process and no product from the same batch had any quality issues reported.

If anyone is expecting it to have a rice-like-texture and EXACT same pack of flavor from a regular nasi lemak, don't bother trying it (duh).\n\nHonestly, I did not expect it to turn out to be good but it was surprisingly delicious! It does resembles the taste of nasi lemak (Mainly from the coconut flavoured chicken and combination of ingredients). The sambal is decent. As a chili/spice lover, I requested for more sambal for my burger and damn it was dripping with sambal goodness! For those of you who likes spicy food, do remember to request for more sambal! It might be abit messy but it was worth it. :)\n\nI ordered the criss cut fries along with my burger. It was salty and flavorful enough for my liking but it was cold and hard when it was served. Also, I ordered a nasi lemak burger and the lady behind me ordered 2 of it. Both of us were dining it, yet, the staff gave her the burgers first. Slightly disappointed in the service. \n\nOverall, kudos to McDonald's for this creation. Would I order it again?

For a product that screams Nasi Lemak, I would expect it to have at least come in a rice bun.\n\nThe main ingredient of nasi Lemak is basically 3/4 nasi (rice) and 1/4 sambal (the one which differentiates a good tasting nasi Lemak and the mehhs). The rest like the chicken, egg and kuning fish are additionals that depends on each individual person.\n\nWithout the Nasi, you can't actually call it Nasi Lemak.

I tot all McDonald outlet should be standardised.. After that I went to causeway pt outlet n approach tis relation manager a Malay guy check with him n he told me tat this promo ve no limits to purchase n while stock last... Told him with regards to the incident n he apologised on behalf of McDonald n the staff. Lastly what's the point of having promo if u can purchase only 1? I can understand if there's stated limits or terms n conditions upon purchase to be fair to the customer not by just verbally frm the counter staff. Her reaction n gesture is really rude n she's not being tactful as she's working in the front line. Spoil my today lastly thanks to the relation manager Mr Ryan Fadhli  Causeway Point who attend to my feedback n queries n clear my doubt.", "created_time": "2015-11-21T05:53:58+0000", "id": "988105451236028_989664631080110"}, {"message": "", "created_time": "2015-11-19T07:20:25+0000", "id": "988105451236028_988861671160406"}, {"message": "Got mine!!!!! #mccafe #mochafrappe", "created_time": "2015-11-19T09:23:10+0000", "id": "988105451236028_988892824490624"}, {"message": "Saleem Has its here again!", "created_time": "2015-11-20T06:47:18+0000", "id": "988105451236028_989275474452359"}, {"message": "Avisha Kumar the one you like!", "created_time": "2015-11-19T08:56:10+0000", "id": "988105451236028_988887474491159"}, {"message": "Hafiz Asyraf now we know where to go next time instead of Starbucks lol", "created_time": "2015-11-19T06:55:40+0000", "id": "988105451236028_988854887827751"}, {"message": "Cynthia Lee hahaha if we are on alot of budget.", "created_time": "2015-11-19T07:53:46+0000", "id": "988105451236028_988868711159702"}, {"message": "Ann Lorraine monday night can?\ud83d\ude02", "created_time": "2015-11-19T08:53:25+0000", "id": "988105451236028_988887054491201"}, {"message": "Winston nakakamiss to ohh", "created_time": "2015-11-22T05:38:13+0000", "id": "988105451236028_990070047706235"}, {"message": "Icy drink when I drink full of ice that is not broken down", "created_time": "2015-11-19T09:11:13+0000", "id": "988105451236028_988890187824221"}, {"message": "June Lee, let's try it out again!", "created_time": "2015-11-19T09:36:52+0000", "id": "988105451236028_988896097823630"}, {"message": "IM SO GONNA GET THIS Jin XunZe", "created_time": "2015-11-20T06:39:46+0000", "id": "988105451236028_989274044452502"}, {"message": "Farah Goh this is the only time you will see me indulge in a cup of ice coffee", "created_time": "2015-11-20T06:17:17+0000", "id": "988105451236028_989269324452974"}, {"message": "Is it true that morning you do not serve this drink?", "created_time": "2015-11-22T02:02:33+0000", "id": "988105451236028_990009637712276"}, {"message": "26nov aje", "created_time": "2015-11-19T07:56:58+0000", "id": "988105451236028_988869144492992"}, {"message": "Bluff ppl de lah i went Farrer park yesterday but not $2 ya....", "created_time": "2015-11-23T06:21:23+0000", "id": "988105451236028_990450107668229"}, {"message": "Offer valid till 25 Nov 2015.

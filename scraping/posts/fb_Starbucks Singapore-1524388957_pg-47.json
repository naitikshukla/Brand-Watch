During this session, Starbucks lets you in on a bit more about our in-house tea offerings. \r\n\r\nTaste the difference as we let guests sample our teas and this season\u2019s exclusive coffee. Let us tell you a bit about our current favourite brew \u2013 the Guatemala Casi Cielo\u2122. \r\n\r\nIf this sounds like a good way to spend a Sat afternoon, sign right up! :) \r\n\r\nThe seminar happens at: \r\n- Starbucks Capital Tower\r\n   168 Robinson Road #01-01/02\r\n   Singapore 068912\r\n- 19 Jan (Sat)\r\n- 3 to 4.30pm \r\n\r\nRSVP with us, along with your contact details, at marketing@starbucks.com.sg \u2013 Seats are limited, so hurry!"}}

It's not the first time we've had a bad experience there, hence, my sending you this post.\nThe staff there are very rude and I believe my burger was prepared way before my order was even taken.  The lettuce was completed \"dead and withered\" as though it had been placed in the microwave.  The beef pattie was hard and dry.  Even though my order was for \"A Classic Beef with Bacon\", there was no bacon whatsoever.\nTo make matters worse, I was asked \"what sauce I would like to have\". When I replied that I would like BBQ sauce I was given only 1.  When I explained that I had two burgers and would like to have 2 sauces, I was very rudely told I could only have 1 because I didn't order the burgers as \"a meal\".  Come on, how much does 1 BBQ sauce cost, considering the amount of money you spend on advertisements.\nI've had vey pleasant experiences at your Stadium outlet, Bedok Mall outlet and several others which means that obviously, your staff must be going through some kind of training - so what about the staff at Siglap Centre.\nI told your staff that I would be writing to you but she obviously thought I was joking.
